description=Design and analysis of 3D seismic survey geometries
version=0.4.6
author=Duijndam.Dev
email=Bart.Duijndam@ziggo.nl
about:<p>This plugin is intended to create and analyze 3D seismic survey geometries. It is dependent on the following Python packages:<ul>
  <li><b>numba</b> (version 0.60.0) Not strictly required, but it <i><b>significantly</b></i> speeds up calculations</li>
  <li><b>numpy</b> (version 1.26.4) <i>should already be installed</i> </li>
  <li><b>pyqtgraph</b> (version 0.13.7) </li>
  <li><b>rasterio</b> (version 1.4.1) </li>
  <li><b>wellpathpy</b> (version 0.5.0) </li>
  <li><b>ptvsd</b> (version 4.3.3) <i>if you want to debug worker threads</i> </li></ul>
  <p>Please install these packages <b>first</b>, using pip from the OSGeo4W command prompt (on Windows)
  <p>Use <b>pip list</b> to detect which packages and versions have already been installed. (E.g. numpy should already be installed)
  <p>Start with installing rasterio (it has quite a few dependencies), followed by numba, pyqtgraph and wellpathpy in that order
  <p>Usage: <b> python -m pip install {package_name}=={package_version}</b>
  <p>
  <p>Whereby rasterio will install (requires) affine, attrs, certifi, chardet, charset-normalizer, click, click-plugins, cligj, and colorama
  <p>And numba will install the llvmlite bindings for the llvm JIT compiler
  <p>
  <p>Please take note:<ul>
  <li>Packages newer than those listed above may have bug fixes (nice) or incompatibilities (not so nice) </li>
  <li>The plugin has not (yet) been tested on Linux or macOS </li>
  <li>The plugin works best on a QHD Screen (2560 x 1440 pixels) or larger </li>
  <li>As of V3.32 High DPI UI scaling issues have arisen in QGIS. See the following discussion on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/53898">here</a> </li> 
  <li>As of version 3.34.6, QGIS upgraded Python from v3.9 to to v3.12 This speeds up calculations and solves some security issues. </li>
  But when <i>upgrading</i> from an earlier QGIS version, it requires installing the above listed packages <b><i>again.</b></i> </li></ul>
  <p>
  <p>As of version 0.4.6 the plugin is <i>(well, should be)</i> compatible with Qt6. Tests are ongoing.
  <p>Therefore the plugin should function with QGIS v3.40 onwards, linked with Qt6 (<i>experimental</i>)

changelog: <p>2025-06-09 (0.4.6) The code has been reformatted to be compatible with Qt6. It should be backwards compatible with Qt5
  <p>(0.4.5) Accept projects that are created from SPS-data only (i.e. projects that are not template-based)
  <p>2025-06-01 (0.4.4) changed the way SPS source points are shown in QGIS: (point, line) has become (line, point) except for parallel/NAZ surveys
  <p>2025-05-11 (0.4.3) several improvements in transferring data from Roll to QGis and vice versa. Created html help page in help menu
  <p>2025-03-05 (0.4.2) refactoring of parameter management code, speeding up display in property pane of surveys with many blocks & seed points
  <p>2025-02-22 (0.4.1) implemented feathering in Marine Wizard; enabled selective drawing of survey details (lines and/or points and/or patterns)
  <p>2025-02-15 (0.4.0) updated Marine Wizard; simplifying data structure in case there's no streamer fanning, significantly speeding up property editing
  <p>2025-02-11 (0.3.9) implemented Marine Wizard for streamer surveys and improved Level of Detail (LOD) rendering in Layout pane
  <p>2024-11-02 (0.3.8) improved editing patterns in Property pane and displaying hem in the Pattern tab. 
  <p>2024-10-22 (0.3.7) introduced multiple seeds per pattern, allowing for very complex pattern layout. Ensured backwards compatibility.  <p>2024-10-15 (0.3.6) added 'pattern' tab for pattern display & analysis. Added convolution with patterns to kx-ky stack response. Fixed an assertion bug in Land Wizard.  <p>2024-10-09 (0.3.5) moved statistics calculations to extended binning. Updated metadata.txt to describe installation of plugin
  <p>2024-07-27 (0.3.6) added 'pattern' tab for pattern display & analysis. Added convolution with patterns to kx-ky stack response. Fixed an assertion bug in Land Wizard
  <p>2024-07-27 (0.3.5) moved statistics calculations to extended binning. Updated metadata.txt to describe installation of plugin
  <p>2024-07-27 (0.3.4) added "inuse" field to src & rec points in QGIS. Implemented a Categorized Symbol Renderer to display used/unused points in QGIS
  <p>2024-07-24 (0.3.3) interface with QGIS improved. Display active / inactive points separately. Fixed rasterio CRS bug
  <p>2024-07-08 (0.3.2) geometry creation from templates now runs significantly faster. Fixed some bugs in Land Survey Wizard
  <p>2024-06-02 (0.3.1) created a 'display' menu. This allows for closing the display pane, when using (small) full HD monitors. Fixed some bugs
  <p>2024-05-27 (0.3.0) reduced minimal width of Geometry & SPS tables, in order to make working with a <i>smallish</i> full HD (1920x1080) screen easier 
  <p>2024-05-23 (0.2.9) expanded numba @jit functions, added rms-offset plot on Layout tab. Fixed some bugs. Implemented function profiling
  <p>2024-05-04 (0.2.8) implemented numba @jit, to speed up calculations. Added stack response analysis and |O| & O/A Histograms. Fixed some bugs
  <p>2024-04-21 (0.2.7) removed all numba @jit references, as exception handling with numba causes problems. Will revisit later
  <p>2024-04-21 (0.2.6) added 'Analysis' tab, containing seven analysis plots
  <p>2024-04-13 (0.2.5) added TWT values to trace table and implemented 'Unique Fold' capability
  <p>2024-04-08 (0.2.4) improved handling of well-files
  <p>2024-03-30 (0.2.3) updated metadata.txt (a) about text and (b) dependencies
  <p>2024-03-30 (0.2.2) improved handling of line- and stake numbers; refactoring of input parameters
  <p>2024-03-13 (0.2.1) initial release on the QGIS plugin website
