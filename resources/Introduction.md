## 2. Current status



### 2.1 Completed

Xml classes for survey building-blocks

Main menu structure & GUI

Level-Of-Detail (LOD) painting in Layout Viewer

Land Wizard (orthogonal, parallel, slant, brick, zig zag)



### 2.2 Under development

Marine Wizard

Binning of templates

### 2.3 Planned

Further integration with QGIS



## 3. To get started



Launch a wizard to generate a new <xml> file, or:

Open an existing *.roll file

Edit the elements that require changing, such as:

-  line intervals
-  point intervals
-  grow steps
-  roll steps

Refresh the view (F5) and check the Layout View for results

For the time being, properties need to be edited in the Xml-structure
